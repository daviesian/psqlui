# PSQL TUI Design Hub

This folder captures the evolving design for a cross-platform terminal UI that lets people connect to, browse, and update PostgreSQL databases. Start here to understand which documents answer common questions.

## Document Map
- [Product Overview](product_overview.md) — audience, goals, and success metrics.
- [Architecture](architecture.md) — platform decisions, layers, and integration points.
- [SQL Intelligence](sql_intelligence.md) — parser/autocomplete strategy and editor services.
- [Plugin Contract](plugin_contract.md) — capability model and lifecycle for extensions.
- [UI Flows](ui_flows.md) — navigation, key screens, and interaction model.
- [Roadmap](roadmap.md) — phased plan from prototype to polish.
- [Ops & Quality](ops_quality.md) — tooling, test strategy, and release hygiene.
- [Progress Log](progress_log.md) — latest commit context, outstanding tasks, and resume instructions.

Each doc includes open questions and next actions so we can iterate once the high-level plan is locked in.
